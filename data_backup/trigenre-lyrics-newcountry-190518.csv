"reba-mcentire","the_christmas_guest","country","It happened one day near December's end Two neighbors called on an old friend And they found his shop so meager and lean Made gay with thousand bows of green And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine And he said,  Old friends, at dawn today When the cock was crowing the night away The Lord appeared in a dream to me  And said,  I'm coming your guest to be  So I've been busy with feet astir Strewing my shop with branches of fern The table is spread and the kettle is shined And over the rafters the holly is twined Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear And listen closely so I will hear His step As He nears my humble place. And I'll open the door and look on His face So his friends went home and left Conrad alone For this was the happiest day he had known For long since, his family had passed away And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest This Christmas would be the dearest and best So he listened with only joy in his heart And with every sound he would rise with a start And look for the Lord to be at his door Like the vision he had had a few hours before So he ran to the window after hearing a sound But all he could see on the snow covered ground Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn And all of his clothes were ragged and worn But Conrad was touched and he went to the door And he said,  You know, your feet must be frozen and sore I have some shoes in my shop for you And a coat that will keep you warmer too  So with grateful heart the man went away But Conrad noticed the time of day And wondered what made the Lord so late And how much longer he'd have to wait When he heard a knock, he ran to the door But it was only a stranger once more A bent old lady with a shawl of black With a bundle of kindling piled on her back She asked for only a place to rest But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest But her voice seemed to plead  Don't send me away Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day  So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup And told her to sit at the table and sup But after she left he was filled with dismay For he saw that the hours were slipping away And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would And Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood When out of the stillness he heard a cry ‚ÄΩPlease help me and tell me where am I?  So again he opened his friendly door And stood disappointed as twice before It was only a child who'd wandered away And was lost from her family on Christmas Day Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad But he knew he should make the little girl glad So he called her in and he wiped her tears And quieted all her childish fears Then he led her back to her home once more But as he entered his own darkened door He knew the Lord was not coming today For the hours of Christmas had passed away So he went to his room and knelt down to pray And he said,  Dear Lord, why did You delay? What kept You from coming to call on me? For I wanted so much Your face to see‚Äù When soft in the silence a voice he heard  Lift up your head for I kept my word Three times my shadow crossed your floor And three times I came to your lonely door   I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet And I was the woman you gave something to eat I was the child on the homeless street Three times I knocked and three times I came in And each time I found the warmth of a friend Of all the gifts, love is the best And I was honored to be your Christmas Guest "

Asked you to marry me, all I had to give was my heart.  While other kids went diving into swimming holes,  You and me dove off into the great unknown.  We were barely gettin' by, takin' care of each other.  Then I became a daddy; you became a mother.  Was an uphill battle nearly every day,  Lookin' back I wouldn't have it any other way.  I'm proud of the house we built.  It's stronger than sticks, stones, and steel.  It's not a big place sittin' up high on some hill.  A lot of things will come and go but love never will.  Oh, I'm proud.  I'm proud of the house we built.  Still workin' our way through the land of milk and honey.  At the end of the day there's always more bills than money.  I close my eyes at night and I still feel  The same fire in my heart I fell out in that hill  I'm proud of the house we built.  It's stronger than sticks, stones, and steel.  It's not a big place sittin' up high on some hill.  A lot of things will come and go but love never will.  Oh, I'm proud.  I'm proud of the house we built.  Oh, look at us today.  Oh, we've come such a long long way.  I'm proud of the house we built.  It's stronger than sticks, stones, and steel.  It's not a big place sittin' up high on some hill.  A lot of things will come and go but love never will.  Oh, I'm proud.  I'm proud of the house we built.  I'm proud of the house we built.  It's stronger than sticks, stones, and steel.  It's not a big place sittin' up high on some hill.  A lot of things will come and go but love never will.  Oh, I'm proud.  I'm proud of the house we built."

I dribbles that ball till the grass was gone and the ground was brown and  Flat. Me and Daddy played horse and the cows all  mooed  and we laughed.

There was an old wooden barrel hind my grandpa's house where we threw our  Tatter peels and coffee grounds, say you want to catch catfish long as your  Arm, son you gotta have a night crawler farm. Well we'd sit on the dock and  Share a bottle of pop and catch a few and then head on back.

When he opened up his eyes I said,  Old man are you ok?  He said,  I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree, I was runin' from some honey bees.

There's the Martin's walkin' in, With that mean little freckle-faced kid, Who broke a window last week. Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me. That's what I love about Sunday: Sing along as the choir sways; Every verse of Amazin' Grace, An' then we shake the Preacher's hand. Go home, into your blue jeans; Have some chicken an' some baked beans. Pick a back yard football team, Not do much of anything: That's what I love about Sunday. I stroll to the end of the drive, Pick up the Sunday Times, grab my coffee cup. It looks like Sally an' Ron, finally tied the knot, Well, it's about time. It's 35 cents off a ground round, Baby, cut that coupon out! That's what I love about Sunday: Cat-napping on the porch swing; You curled up next to me, The smell of jasmine wakes us up. Take a walk down a back road, Tackle box and a cane pole; Carve our names in that white oak, An' steal a kiss as the sun fades, That's what I love about Sunday, Oh, yeah. Ooh, new believers gettin' baptized, Momma's hands raised up high, Havin' a Hallelujah good time A smile on everybody's face. That's what I love about Sunday, Oh, yeah. That's what I love about Sunday, Oh, yeah."
